# Basic information about project

Greetings! Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the selection process. Here you can find some information about the things I did and things I did not.

## Employee Data

When I started working on the projects, I examined the employee entries data and found out that some of the entries had missing names, and some of the entries had deleted-on property set to a value. My understanding was that entries with no names should belong to a separate category and that entries with the deleted-on property should not be taken into count, since they have been deleted.

## Scalability

I tried to make this project as much future friendly as possible, by creating many services and separating some of the controller logic.

## Testing

I strive to implement integration and unit tests into every app I make, but in this case I did not have time to do so. Some things were more important (Unfortunate excuse for many apps in the world).

## Chart

Chart differs from the one in the Angular app, because the one hosted on CDN had a bug and it rendered some whitespace as a piece of the pie-chart. I tried debugging it in every way I thought of and I could not fix it, hence the diversity. It will be created on visiting the Employee Information page and it will reside inside the wwwroot images folder.
